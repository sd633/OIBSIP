      <h2>Early life</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1971</strong> Musk was born to a South African father and a
          Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and
          entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a
          computer magazine.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1988</strong> After obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left
          South Africa because he sought the greater economic opportunities
          available in the United States.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1992 to 1997</strong> Musk attended Queen’s University in
          Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of
          Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in
          physics and economics in 1997.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1995</strong> He founded Zip2, a company that provided maps
          and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought
          by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million. Musk then
          founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later
          became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The
          online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>SpaceX</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2002</strong>In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies
          (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were
          the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first
          launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than
          competing rockets.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2018</strong> A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched
          in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit,
          nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s
          Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2019</strong> and <strong>2020</strong> SpaceX is developing
          Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended
          to replace the Falcon 9 and Heavy. In <strong>2020</strong>, SpaceX
          launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first
          private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed
          spacecraft with the ISS.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2015</strong> SpaceX began development of the Starlink
          constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide
          satellite Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites
          launched in February <strong>2018</strong>. A second set of test
          satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the
          constellation occurred in May <strong>2019</strong>, when the first 60
          operational satellites were launched.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2022</strong> During Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent
          Starlink systems to Ukraine to provide internet access and
          communication, an action praised by Ukrainian president Volodymyr
          Zelenskyy.However, he refused to block Russian state media on
          Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech absolutist.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tesla</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in
          <strong>2003</strong> by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who
          financed the company until the Series A round of funding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2004</strong>Musk led the Series A round of investment. He
          invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined
          Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong>Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and
          product architect.<strong>2019</strong> As of 2019, Musk was the
          longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2006</strong>Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster,
          which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most
          previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and
          uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles
          (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2010</strong> The company’s initial public offering raised
          about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S
          sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance
          and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV,
          which went on the market in 2015.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2013</strong>Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68
          billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk in 2013
          proposed an alternate faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube
          in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560
          km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed
          of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the speed of sound.
